         * Unfortunately, Moodle assumes that all instances of an activity use
         * the same grade item numbers. Ad Astra has a varying number of exercises
         * in each exercise round and thus, a varying number of grade items.
         * As a quick workaround, this function assumes that no exercise round
         * has over 30 exercises. We hardcode dummy grade item names for
         * 30 exercises here.
         *
         * In the future, Ad Astra should possibly completely remove grade items
         * for exercises. Only the grade item of the exercise round would remain
         * and it would show the total points of the exercise round as before.
